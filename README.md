# **Hybrid-FrFT**
Hybrid fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) framework for digital off-axis holographic microscopy.

---

## **Overview**
This repository contains MATLAB scripts accompanying the article:  

**"Hybrid fractional Fourier transform for filtering and imaging in a single digital holography workflow"**  

The scripts implement a **hybrid optical–digital FrFT approach** that unifies filtering and reconstruction in digital off-axis holography, enabling tunable diffraction order size, bandwidth, and position within a single workflow.
